<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've found that battery life never matches the manufacturer's statistics considering that this comes from tests in a regulated environment without continuous video recording, which is the most significant perpetrator for brief battery life without a doubt. We concur with you about Blink's superior battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, but its recording capacity is a bit limited to recommend as a top choice.</p>
<p>The cost of a home security system varies by provider. Some suppliers permit you to choose from predetermined equipment packages while others work with you to develop a tailored security system. Some security systems don't require any equipment payment upfront, while others may cost as much as $1,300.00 to start. Suppliers vary in their payment structures, so it is very important to understand how you'll be expected to spend for your system.</p>
<p>Even though 1080p is typically the basic resolution for cameras we have actually checked, there are advantages to designs with higher-resolution sensors. Few home security cameras have optical zoom lenses, but practically all have digital zoom, which crop and increase the size of whatever the camera is taping. The more megapixels a camera sensing unit has, the more you can digitally zoom in and still be able to see things plainly.</p>
