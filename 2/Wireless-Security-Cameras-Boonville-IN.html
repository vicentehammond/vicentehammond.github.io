<p>Megapixel Cameras Now Readily Available. ASecureLife's recommendation: Go to Ring for a well-priced Do It Yourself system that you can self-monitor or get professionally monitored for a small cost. We suggest the eight-piece package since it includes several windows and door sensing units for full protection. We also advise adding a doorbell camera eventually. The upfront cost of wireless security systems can be expensive. Consider the upfront cost of the control board, activation charges, monitoring fees and all equipment. All of these costs will be paid in advance if the wireless security system is not on an agreement basis. Some customers report investing $500 up to $2,000 to start their wireless security system.</p>

A few minutes into the Do It Yourself installation, our tester got stuck getting her control panel up and online-- it simply would not link. An aid window turned up with a number to call, and a Frontpoint associate helped her troubleshoot the connection. After about 10 minutes, he could tell there was a concern with the circuit board. Definitely not ideal-- but the associate apologized and delivered her replacement control board over night.</p>
