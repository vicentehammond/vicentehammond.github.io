<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Also great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
