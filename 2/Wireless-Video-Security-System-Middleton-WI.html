<p>The Nest Labs Nest Webcam provides higher-than-typical 1080p video resolution. Whatever Vivint does, it succeeds. Where other alarm companies use a collection of third-party equipment, Vivint styles its own things. Where some choices, like ADT, have good equipment but so-so cameras, Vivint's cameras have some of the best features on the market, including video analytics and 4K image sensors (as well as more standard fare like motion detectors, two-way audio, and night vision).</p>
<p>ADT also deals with Z-Wave and supports a bunch of various wise home devices as well as some indoor and outdoor cameras. But you need to sign up for the right monitoring plan to get support for stuff like that. Cellphone cameras, in the hands of a careful public, are a lot more discriminating than CCTV cameras.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not excellent-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>
