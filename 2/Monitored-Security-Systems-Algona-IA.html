<p>Linking analog cameras with a DVR system is done by method of directly plugging a BNC cable television from the DVR into the camera. To connect more cameras to the DVR system, you need additional cables. DVR systems are tough to scale up since as soon as every BNC connection is inhabited by a camera, you need to buy a totally new DVR prior to adding another camera to the system.
