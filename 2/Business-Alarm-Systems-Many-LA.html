The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Likewise good metal building.

Must be a much better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>

<p>The genuine reason cameras are generally deployed is to reduce much pettier crimes. However it has not even been shown that they can do that. In Britain, where cameras have been thoroughly deployed in public locations, sociologists studying the issue have actually found that they have actually not minimized criminal activity.

A 2005 study for the British Office also discovered that cameras did not cut criminal offense or the worry of criminal offense (as had a 2002 study, also for the British government).</p>
