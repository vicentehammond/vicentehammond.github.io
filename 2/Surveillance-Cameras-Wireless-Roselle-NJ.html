When people are being watched by the authorities - or aware they might be watched at any time - they are more awkward and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has pointed out, "knowing that you are being watched by armed government representatives tends to put a damper on things. You do not wish to anger them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he alerts, "people might discover to be cautious about the regulars and books they check out in public, avoiding titles that may alarm unseen observers. They may likewise put more believed into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang druggies, hookers or members."
