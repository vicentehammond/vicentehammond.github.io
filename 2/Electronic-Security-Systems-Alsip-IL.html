<p>Establishing a secure and safe environment for a commercial or house is the responsibility of the entire community. Storage capability: For video recorders, the very first question you need to ask yourself is how much storage you will require. The response depends upon a couple of aspects: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video you intend to keep and how long you prepare to keep documented footage. If there are numerous cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the footage is going to eat up storage space rapidly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest footage when you reach the system's capacity, however if you're not careful, the system may overwrite archived video that you still require.</p>
<p>No incorrect alarm charges: Property owners with a self-monitored system are less likely to dispatch the authorities for an incorrect alarm. Given that the property owner supervises of the system, authorities are only called if there's a genuine emergency. On the other hand, a professional monitoring company will call authorities if a house owner can't validate an incorrect alarm. If  authorities are contacted for a false alarm, house owners may need to pay a fine for dispatching police unnecessarily. A self-monitored home limitations the potential for subsequent charges and false alarms.</p>

<p>Closed circuit television (CCTV) surveillance is a kind of situational criminal activity avoidance created to prevent both personal and residential or commercial property criminal activity and can be used in location of, or in addition to, police. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and transfer pictures of a specific location of interest and are either monitored remotely by security workers or preprogramed to scan the defined location (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is believed that the increased surveillance provided by CCTV will decrease crime and increase arrest, without displacing crime to other close-by areas where CCTV is not in usage (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>
