<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, most alarm systems work the exact same method. They use open and closed circuits to transfer an electrical present. When this electrical current is not being moved it sets off an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which suggests if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If somebody were to open the door that would imply that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then set off the burglar alarm. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking allows for the electrical current to stream throughout the system, which implies when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will trigger.</p>
