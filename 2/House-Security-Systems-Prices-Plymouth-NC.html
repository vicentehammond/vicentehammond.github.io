They offer versatility in their equipment and available plans, permitting homeowners to choose the security service that best fits their requirements. Unfortunately, there are some disadvantages to Safeguard America indicated by their low C- rating from BBB. A bulk of the problems center around misinformation concerning the obligatory 3 year contract. In reality, most customers were not conscious they were making such a long term dedication.

In terms of detection, it is much better to have a camera equipped with infrared detection instead of motion detection. Because often times the motion detection is set off by movement such as a tree blowing or an animal running by, this will offer more accurate and less regular alerts.</p>
