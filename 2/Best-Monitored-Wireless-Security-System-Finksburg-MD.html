<h3>Home Security Systems Near Me in Maryland</h3>

<p>Unlike many other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter event alerts only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When utilized in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals every time you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports several users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>

You press a button in the app to talk, and, while you're talking, you can't hear what's occurring on the other end.
