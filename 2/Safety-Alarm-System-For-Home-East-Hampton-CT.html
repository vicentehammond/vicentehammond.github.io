Even if you run out power for days, the system must still be able to call for aid. If somebody cuts the phone line, though, you will not be able to utilize the system to call for assistance.</p>
<p>We inform non-residential and residential alarm system owners, operators and users about the alarm license requirement and false alarm prevention measures.

<p>Good image and I like that the cameras are white, they do not stick out excessive. Pretty easy to install.
