The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification.

Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening.
