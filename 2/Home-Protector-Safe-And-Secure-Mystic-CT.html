<p>3 huge advantages of wireless security systems for tenants are their expandability, mobility and impermanence. Occupants, unlike property owners, generally prevent making permanent modifications to their homes. Hardwired security systems for that reason aren't practical; they involve drilling into walls and setting up permanent electrical circuits. In contrast, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entrances with detachable adhesive. Wireless control board, sensing units and other elements can quickly be set up at different residential or commercial properties in the future, and wireless systems are easily broadened with new elements too. Wireless security plans also permit push-button control of the system and basic home automation. Check out our list of top systems with home automation functions if home automation is your main appeal.</p>
<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, typically referred to as shock sensors, are different in that they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces specific shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Typically, the most intense frequencies generated are in between 3 and 5 kHz, depending on the type of glass and the existence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn create an alarm condition.</p>
