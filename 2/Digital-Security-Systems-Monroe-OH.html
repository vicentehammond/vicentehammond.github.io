Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is more useful when utilized in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts each time you walk by.
