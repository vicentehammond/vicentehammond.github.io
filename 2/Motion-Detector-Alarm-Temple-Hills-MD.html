<p>Analog hd cameras are a terrific option for services to update from analog CCTV that has actually already been wired using coax cable or CAT-5 cable television. AHD cameras utilize the same RG59 or RG6 cable television as traditional CCTV cameras. CAT-5 cable television with video baluns can likewise be used.
