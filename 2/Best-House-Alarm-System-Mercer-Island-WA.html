<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the really principle of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has actually come a long way, covering a number of decades. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology slowly progressed into the extremely advanced yet budget friendly systems readily available today. The first uses of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to tape-record video and view it later. Although video surveillance was monitored out of need in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to improve the result of security systems.</p>
<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do these days - you will probably be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the large amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at really quick speeds, and typically over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reliable, however not compatible with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will likewise power the security cameras, eliminating the need for further wiring. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might need less wiring in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera individually, usually by means of 110VAC power.</p>
