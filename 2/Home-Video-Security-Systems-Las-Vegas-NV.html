By integrating LiveWatch Do It Yourself security systems with Moni's expert monitoring, we can see Brinks Home Security competing with other huge names in the market. During our hands-on screening of Brinks, we found the systems to be rather easy to set up and utilize-- but not quite as easy as brands like SimpliSafe or Ring Alarm.</p>
