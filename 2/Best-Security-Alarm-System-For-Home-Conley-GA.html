<p>Another essential topic to talk about is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to understand how much is enough. In this article, the term resolution" refers to the number of dots (pixels) that comprise a video picture; the more dots, the more in-depth the video image. The very same holds true of high-resolution TV sets, and the two most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution contains about 4 times as much image information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also manufactured in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. When it comes to surveillance cameras, there are some tricky consequences to having such a high-resolution 4K image. In this case, more is not always much better.</p>
