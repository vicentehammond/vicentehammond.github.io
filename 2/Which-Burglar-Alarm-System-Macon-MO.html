<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
