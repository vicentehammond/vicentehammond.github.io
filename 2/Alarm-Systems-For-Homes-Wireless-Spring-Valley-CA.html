<p>Vivint, Frontpoint, ADT, Link, and Brinks all use smart locks, video doorbells, thermostats, and other home automation gadgets that you can manage from your smart device. Other brand names, like Ring and Nest Secure, provide a handful of cool wise gadgets. And some brands don't offer wise equipment of their own but do incorporate with common wise home systems. Here's a take a look at Vivint security cameras for indoor and outdoor surveillance. Signed up for service for my Simon XTi and was active with their service an hour later on. The company that installed my alarm went out of business so I was on the hunt for a new monitoring company. These people are $18 a month cheaper and been in business 3 years so I'm comfortable providing a try.

So is the plan for recordings from several cameras: $10 a month or $100 a year.</p>
