As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally regular since the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everyone entering the store.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly impressive on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.

But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
