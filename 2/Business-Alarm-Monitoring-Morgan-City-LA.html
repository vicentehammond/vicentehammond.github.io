<p>Another essential subject to discuss is camera resolution. It can be confusing to understand how much is enough. In this article, the term resolution" describes the number of dots (pixels) that comprise a video picture; the more dots, the more detailed the video image. The exact same holds true of high-resolution TV sets, and the two most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about four times as much picture info as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also produced in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. When it concerns surveillance cameras, there are some difficult repercussions to having such a high-resolution 4K image. In this case, more is not always much better.</p>
