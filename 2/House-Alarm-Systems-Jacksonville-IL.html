<p>No incorrect alarm charges: Property owners with a self-monitored system are less likely to dispatch the authorities for an incorrect alarm. Because the house owner supervises of the system, police are just called if there's a genuine emergency situation.

If  authorities are called for a false alarm, homeowners may need to pay a fine for dispatching cops unnecessarily. A self-monitored home limits the capacity for incorrect alarms and subsequent charges.</p>
