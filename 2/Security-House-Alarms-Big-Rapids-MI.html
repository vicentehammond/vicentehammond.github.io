Like any invasive innovation, the benefits of deploying public video cameras should be stabilized versus the dangers and expenses. This technology (a) has the possible modification the core experience of going out in public in America because of its chilling effect on people, (b) brings very genuine threats of abuse and "mission creep," and (c) would not considerably protect us against terrorism.
