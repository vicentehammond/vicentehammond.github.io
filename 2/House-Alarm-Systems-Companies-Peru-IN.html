Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When utilized in high-traffic areas, the membership is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs each time you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
