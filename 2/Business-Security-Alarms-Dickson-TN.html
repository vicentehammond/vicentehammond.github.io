<p>The NVR eliminates these problems, because it is rather linked straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the exact same network, typically by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply because they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transmit video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the exact same network as the NVR. The largest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will be compatible with an offered video recorder before purchasing.</p>

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features.
