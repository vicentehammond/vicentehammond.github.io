<p>Get best-in-class security, plus clever home automation the entire family will enjoy. ADT is a household name, so we regularly try their systems to ensure they're still up-to-task. In our newest round of screening, we recognized that ADT is the most popular provider for a reason. We think their home protection + home automation + video packages are nipping at the heels of Vivint.

<p>There's no dedicated center included here - each camera links straight to your router via Wi-Fi, and streams to your phone (or to the outside world) from there. That's a neat service, or at least one that saves a power socket and an Ethernet port, but we can't assist but feel it's likewise the factor for the Swann's slightly slow reaction times.

Here's how it plays out: First you need to download the app and put in your email address. Then you enter the WiFi details of the network you're attempting to connect to. Then the phone plays a screeching, electronic sound wave to the camera to send the WiFi information. (You need to play this at full volume or it will not work). Windows smash, dogs groan, felines shriek, babies cry. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the first ten seconds. It doesn't work. And it never ever works.</p>
