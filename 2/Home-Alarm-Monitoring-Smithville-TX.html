<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Also great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
