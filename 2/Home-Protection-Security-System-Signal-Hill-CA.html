<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against theft, scams, and vandalism. Tip: Frequently keyholders are not readily available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we should once again react to the alarm; each reaction is billed.

For that reason, each house owner needs to consider their own risk tolerance, but it's usually worth investing in a real home security system that provides strong peace of mind.</p>
