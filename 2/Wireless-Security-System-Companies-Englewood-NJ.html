<p>We have all heard that old stating, you get what you spend for". Wireless is the way of the future. Some leading home security companies offer expert installation, while others preconfigure your system at the factory and ship to your door for simply DIY setup. See the best wireless choices listed below. Frontpoint Security uses a basic and clever  monitored home security service, utilizing a wide variety of various wireless gadgets.

House owners can choose from indoor or outdoor security cameras that can tape-record video when an alarm is activated, video doorbell cameras, spotlight cameras, baby-sitter cameras, and more.
