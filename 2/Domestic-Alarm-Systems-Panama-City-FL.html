Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>
