One important exception: ADT has a landline monitoring plan that's $36.99 monthly, which could be an inexpensive option for consumers in backwoods.

If you live someplace without access to cellular monitoring, a landline system is still much better than no security at all.</p>

<p>Nurse calling systems typically consist of emergency situation buttons or pull strings within the patient's restroom.
