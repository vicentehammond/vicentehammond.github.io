<p>CR's take: The Wyze Web Cam V2 is a great security camera and an incredible value. It receives an Outstanding rating for video quality and is much easier to utilize than the other cameras on this list. It also succeeds in our privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 14 days of totally free storage for motion-trigged video clips, person detection, voice control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to store video locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not use paid subscription plans for extra cloud storage. But the company does use a Complete Motion Capture service that continuously records for as long as motion is identified. Without an sd or the service card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>
<p>Unlike other home security service providers, Armorax has you buy equipment yourself, rather than lease it.

The hardware includes a 3-5 year warranty and a $199 installation cost.

You'll also pay more for professional installation through ADT than you would through Vivint, particularly for cameras. And to be sincere, we're not terribly impressed by ADT's cameras in the very first place. What you're paying for is mostly that big name in blue.</p>
