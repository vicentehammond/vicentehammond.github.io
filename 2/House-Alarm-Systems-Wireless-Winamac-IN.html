<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Also good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
