<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring subtle but profound changes to the character of our public spaces. When residents are being seen by the authorities - or aware they might be seen at any time - they are more awkward and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has pointed out, "understanding that you are being seen by armed government agents tends to deter things. You do not want to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he alerts, "individuals may find out to be cautious about the books and regulars they read in public, avoiding titles that may alarm unseen observers. They might also put more believed into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang druggies, hookers or members." Indeed, the studies of cameras in Britain found that people deemed to be "out of time and place" with the surroundings were subjected to prolonged surveillance.</p>

When you include other Ring products to Ring Alarm it becomes a more robust security system that can deliver live video streaming, two-way interaction, and smart lighting.
