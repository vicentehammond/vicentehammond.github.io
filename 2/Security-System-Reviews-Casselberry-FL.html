Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests utilizing 2 various 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units located 6 to 26 feet far from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were unable to replicate the issue.

<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Also great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
