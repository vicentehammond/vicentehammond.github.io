Storage capability: For video recorders, the very first question you have to ask yourself is just how much storage you will need. The response depends upon a number of aspects: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video footage you mean to save and how long you prepare to keep documented video. If there are many cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the video is going to consume storage space quickly.
