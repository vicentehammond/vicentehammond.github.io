<p>Most modern-day CCTV video surveillance systems incorporate DVRs (digital video recorders) which enable operators to reap some of the advantages of a network-based surveillance setup. DVRs transform the analog video to digital, which helps to extend storage capability, makes it a lot easier to browse archived video, and likewise allows users to stream video over a network for remote watching from numerous locations. Typically, the mere presence of security cameras can frighten less-motivated trespassers. However keeping them hidden and out of sight can keep them from being tampered with or damaged by the more identified intruders. They might also be less careful about covering their faces and their tracks if burglars can not see any security cameras.</p>
