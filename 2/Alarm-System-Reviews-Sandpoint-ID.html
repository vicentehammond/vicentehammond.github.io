<p>The Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is among the most expensive home security cameras around, but it's also one of the most intelligent, too. This weatherproof home security camera has a tamper-resistant design, a triple microphone selection and HDR assistance for better-quality videos than what other cameras produce. It needs to be plugged in to work-- no battery choice here, sorry-- however the camera includes a 25-foot power cable, which must assist with installation.</p>
<p>A camera with Wi-Fi can communicate with your home network wirelessly, which can be useful for installation.

Unfortunately I acquired 4 cameras that look just like these, believing I was going to save $14.00 per camera for the exact same camera. Kid was I incorrect!! These cameras hold true 1080p and work perfectly right out of the box. They are well aligned and focused. The clarity is truly terrific. Night vision is true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you need to buy, and don't go cheap.</p>
