Property owners selecting a system must try to find a dependable, reliable company.

<p>Unlike many other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter occasion alerts just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the membership is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals each time you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
