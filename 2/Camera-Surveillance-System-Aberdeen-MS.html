The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting components, which I had actually installed on the porch by a certified electrical contractor (who occurs to be my partner).

To achieve almost anything, somebody live" required to be on the other side of the table or telephone line, particularly when handling worldwide and national business. The same applies for security and video surveillance. Usually, CCTV is most reliable as an active system, with a security guard monitoring the corridors and another person, somewhere, seeing video surveillance monitors for support.
