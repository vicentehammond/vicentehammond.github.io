<p>Three huge benefits of wireless security systems for tenants are their impermanence, expandability and portability. Renters, unlike property owners, typically prevent making permanent changes to their homes. Hardwired security systems therefore aren't useful; they include drilling into walls and installing permanent electrical circuits. In contrast, wireless security utilizes equipment that's either freestanding or affixed to walls and entrances with detachable adhesive. Wireless control board, sensors and other elements can quickly be set up at various properties later on, and wireless systems are quickly broadened with new elements too. Wireless security plans also permit remote control of the system and general home automation.
