<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Also good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Should be a better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
