<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Also nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Need to be a better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
