Imagine what someone like that might do with a citywide spy-camera system.</p>
<p>Unlike most other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter event alerts only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs whenever you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
