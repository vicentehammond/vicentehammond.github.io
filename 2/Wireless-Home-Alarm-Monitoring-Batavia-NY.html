<p>The night vision on this camera is applauded time and once again in client reviews, and it provides a crisp photo as much as 32 feet.

Instead, you can filter occasion notices only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription).

Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent alerts whenever you walk by.
