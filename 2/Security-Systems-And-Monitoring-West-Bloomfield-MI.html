<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, normally referred to as shock sensing units, are different in that they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which travel through the glass and frequently through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Typically, the most extreme frequencies produced are in between 3 and 5 kHz, depending upon the type of glass and the presence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn generate an alarm condition.</p>
