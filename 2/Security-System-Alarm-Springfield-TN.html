<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you want one? Here is a quick explanation of how thermal cameras work: All things release infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature. The infrared energy given off by an object is called its heat signature. In general, the hotter an item is, the more radiation it gives off. A thermal camera consists of a heat sensing unit that is capable of spotting small distinctions in temperature level. The gadget gathers the infrared radiation from things in the scene and produces an electronic image based on details about the temperature differences. Since things are rarely specifically the same temperature as other things around them, a thermal camera can discover them, and they will look like unique in a thermal image.</p>
