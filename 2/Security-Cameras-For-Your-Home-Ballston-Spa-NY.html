<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Also good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Must be a better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>

<p>Take note of the existing lighting in the areas where you want to install security cameras. Search for the night vision variety of each camera and think about just how much location you wish to cover. And beware of utilizing an indoor camera to look outside; they can't generally catch images through a window or after dark.

<p>When looking at a typical camera image, you would be hard-pressed to inform the difference in between 1080p and 4K resolution. The one major benefit of 4K resolution is the ability to resolve detail after the reality, which indicates that users can focus on details such as faces while the recording of a security event plays.

If extended video storage is essential, be prepared to spend more cash.</p>
