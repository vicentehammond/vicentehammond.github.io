Disk drive storage is safe, secure, and practical, with lots of systems using expansion and totally free cloud storage, such as Arlo Pro 2 Wireless Home Security System. Where does the video feed go? Does the camera shop to an SD card, which you'll require to manually get rid of to transfer the data? Does it go to your smartphone, or upload to services like Dropbox?
