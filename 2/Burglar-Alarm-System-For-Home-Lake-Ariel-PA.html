<p>The remainder of the field is more specialized, catering to advanced wise home aficionados or fans of a particular ecosytem of items. Nest's Secure has the best design of any system I checked, consisting of creative things like incorporating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one system. However the Secure is expensive, additional sensing units are expensive, and the monitoring service-- which does not consist of fire alarms or camera backups-- is also costly if you do not devote to a three-year contract.</p>
<p>For smart home functions, we suggest the ADT Pulse plan. It provides complete IFTTT (If This Then That) technology to let you from another location arm and deactivate your system, turn lights and other electronic devices on and off, and manage the thermostat so you never ever need to come home to a chilly house. ADT likewise works with Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa so you can manage your security system with your voice. 10,000 watchful citizens with smartphones is much better security than one security person seeing 10,000 individuals on CCTV.</p>
