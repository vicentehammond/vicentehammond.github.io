<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night.

The technology slowly evolved into the extremely advanced yet cost effective systems readily available today. The first usages of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to record video and see it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of requirement in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to enhance the result of security systems.</p>
<p>When using IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do these days - you will more than likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the big quantity of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at really fast speeds, and frequently over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reliable, but not compatible with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the need for more electrical wiring. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may need less electrical wiring in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera individually, typically by means of 110VAC power.</p>
