The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Also nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Should be a much better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
