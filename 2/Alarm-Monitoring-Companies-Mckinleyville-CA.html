However, the reality that alarm calls are extremely incorrect and do not contribute significantly to cops ability to apprehend burglars makes the underwriting of alarm response by police and whole neighborhoods (all taxpayers fund police action to alarmed properties) a costly and inefficient  technique to break-in decrease throughout a whole jurisdiction.</p>
