<p>So, while alarm may have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a general security plan, the concern stays whether non-alarm owners in the community should take on a share of the cost.

However, the reality that alarm calls are extremely incorrect and do not contribute significantly to cops ability to apprehend burglars makes the underwriting of alarm response by police and whole neighborhoods (all taxpayers fund police action to alarmed properties) a costly and inefficient  technique to break-in decrease throughout a whole jurisdiction.</p>
