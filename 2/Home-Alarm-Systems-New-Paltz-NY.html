<p>Because it's more complex than it should be, we do not recommend the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, informs, and integration all need different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are stored for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month fee (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limits, we often discovered action missing out on, thanks to lengthy and irregular gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
