<p>So, while alarm might have some advantage for alarm owners as part of a total security package, the question stays whether non-alarm owners in the community ought to shoulder a share of the cost. If alarm usage resulted in enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, fewer thefts across a whole jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more evident. Nevertheless, the truth that alarm calls are extremely false and do not contribute significantly to cops capability to nab intruders makes the underwriting of alarm action by police and whole neighborhoods (all taxpayers support authorities action to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a pricey and inefficient  method to theft reduction across an entire jurisdiction.</p>
