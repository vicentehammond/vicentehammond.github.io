<p>Possible burglars by and large choose easier targets with the least amount of risk included. Property owners also in some cases install fake security cameras using the exact same thinking.

This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread that image throughout a far bigger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
