Storage capability: For video recorders, the first concern you have to ask yourself is just how much storage you will need. The answer depends upon a couple of aspects: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video footage you mean to store and the length of time you plan to keep taped video footage. If there are lots of cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the footage is going to consume storage space rapidly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest footage once you reach the system's capability, but if you're not careful, the system may overwrite archived video footage that you still need.</p>
<p>Conserving uncompressed digital recordings takes up an enormous quantity of disk drive space, and a couple of hours of uncompressed video could quickly fill up a hard drive.
