<p>Not all home security systems need customers to sign an agreement. However it's crucial to carefully analyze the agreement provided by those that do. Consider that some companies lock you into their service for a year or more. Breaking the contract might cost you hundreds of dollars. The Arlo Pro is the company's very first wireless home security camera, and though it's been eclipsed in features and resolutions by more recent designs, the original still holds up well.
