<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Likewise great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
