<p>The NVR gets rid of these problems, due to the fact that it is rather connected directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the very same network, usually by method of a PoE switch, are then able to send footage to the NVR.

In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The biggest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
