<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing.

Also, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just by means of a computer system.

Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
