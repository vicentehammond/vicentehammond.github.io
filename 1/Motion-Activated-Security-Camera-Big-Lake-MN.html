However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>
