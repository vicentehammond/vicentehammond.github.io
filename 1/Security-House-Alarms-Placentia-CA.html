<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by way of directly plugging a BNC cable television from the DVR into the camera. To connect more cameras to the DVR system, you require additional cables. DVR systems are hard to scale up since when every BNC connection is occupied by a camera, you need to acquire a totally new DVR prior to including another camera to the system.
