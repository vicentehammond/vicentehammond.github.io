<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not fantastic-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely typical considering that the entrance and space seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once clients recognize that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
