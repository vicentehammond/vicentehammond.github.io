<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've found that battery life never ever matches the producer's stats given that this comes from tests in a regulated environment without continuous video recording, which is the most significant offender for short battery life without a doubt. We agree with you about Blink's exceptional battery life over on our outdoor security camera evaluation, but its recording capacity is a bit minimal to recommend as a top choice.</p>
<p>Aside from good Wi-Fi, you may also require a close-by outlet. The majority of cameras need an AC connection, which means you won't be able to put them just anywhere. Several of the cameras we evaluated offered the choice to utilize battery power, but we have yet to discover the ideal one.
