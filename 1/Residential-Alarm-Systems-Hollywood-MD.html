<p>We do not recommend the SmartThings SmartCam since it's more complex than it should be. Recordings, notifies, and integration all need different IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly cost (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limitations, we frequently found action missing out on, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
<p>Unlike most other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event alerts only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The membership is more useful when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent alerts every time you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
