<p>Unlike wired security systems that run through your phone lines and can need more comprehensive installation, wireless systems can be set up in a matter of minutes as a painless and fast Do It Yourself project. Benefit is the significant reason people change to wireless," states Du, and it's difficult to refute a 10-minute setup when the wired choice requires expert installation of wires below your house.

However if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
