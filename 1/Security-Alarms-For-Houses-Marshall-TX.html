<p>Many security cameras can be used both inside and outdoors. They usually have the very same features like night vision or remote watching, however they vary in durability. Outdoor cameras must be weather condition resistant and in many cases, totally waterproof. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather condition resistance rating are the most durable. Bullet cameras tend to be amongst the most popular outdoor choices due to the fact that their style enables minimum glare. In terms of detection, it is much better to have a camera equipped with infrared detection instead of motion detection. Because often times the motion detection is set off by movement such as a tree blowing or an animal running by, this will supply more precise and less regular signals.</p>

Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly cost (or $80 annually) to save 30-second clips for 1 month.
