Outdoor cameras must be weather condition resistant and in many cases, totally waterproof. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather condition resistance rating are the most durable. Bullet cameras tend to be amongst the most popular outdoor choices due to the fact that their style enables minimum glare. In terms of detection, it is much better to have a camera equipped with infrared detection instead of motion detection.
