<h3>Domestic Security Systems Zebulon NC 27597</h3>
<p>CR's take: The Wyze Cam V2 is a great security camera and a phenomenal value. It gets an Excellent ranking for video quality and is much easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It also does well in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 14 days of complimentary storage for motion-trigged video clips, individual detection, voice control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to keep footage locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not offer paid membership plans for extra cloud storage. However the company does use a Total Motion Capture service that constantly records for as long as motion is detected. Without an sd or the service card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>
<p>Keypad: A mobile phone app is a should for usage when you're far from home, but you should not need to fumble with your phone when you're going and coming. A keypad can sit by the front door, making it simple to arm and disarm the system. Including Ring Alarm makes sense if you currently own a Ring video doorbell and want to broaden your home security protection. When you add other Ring items to Call Alarm it becomes a more robust security system that can deliver live video streaming, two-way communication, and clever lighting. Of course, at that point, the cheap price becomes more pricey.</p>
<p>Vivint also gives you the freedom to advance your home's automation at your own speed.

Plus, Vivint makes it easy to control the functions you do choose through either its instinctive mobile app or the low-profile, wall-mounted SkyControl tablet.</p>
