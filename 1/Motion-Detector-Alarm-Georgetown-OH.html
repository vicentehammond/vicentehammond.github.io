<p>Thanks to recent improvements in innovation, wireless security systems are now as effective as wired systems If you have actually decided to install a burglar alarm, you should think about the following advantages of wireless innovation. For some, that may be worth the $300 cost. But while we like the clever functions and home automation compatibility of the Nest Web cam IQ, a lot of the cameras we looked at offer the exact same advantages at a more sensible cost.
