<p>While it strikes the resolution, we think there's a little interpolation on its 4K video considered that the Arlo Ultra's recordings can tend to be a little smeary when zoomed right in, however this is still by far the sharpest security camera we have actually seen in action, wireless or otherwise. Watch on what matters by streaming your security camera on your TV using Google Nest or Home speaker or display screen and Chromecast or a TV with Chromecast built-in.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion triggers.</p>

Although battery replacements are needed, these are the easiest option to install and all of the tape-recorded video is kept in the cloud.</p>
