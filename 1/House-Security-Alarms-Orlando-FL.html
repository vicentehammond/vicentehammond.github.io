We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have horrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>
