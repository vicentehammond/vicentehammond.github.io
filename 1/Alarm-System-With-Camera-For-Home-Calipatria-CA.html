<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely normal considering that the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
