<p>A little more costly than our winning wise alarm, this system was practically as simple to install and, throughout testing, the loud, clear siren was quick to sound if one of the sensors had been triggered. We love that the system includes a wifi security camera and only signals you when motion is developed by something with the same heat pattern as a human (ensuring there's no false informs). However, you do need to register for the external monitoring service (from â‚¤ 12.99 per month) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get alerts on your phone if the sensors have actually been activated.
