However, the camera will reset the sensor in between recordings, which Arlo says will allow the camera to correctly discover motion and not get stuck tape-recording on a loop. That also saves battery life, however it might leave you with recording gaps throughout crucial security occasions. If home security is your main concern, we 'd suggest among our top picks, but the Arlo is fantastic for signing in on household and pets-- or roaming cats sliding around your backyard.</p>
