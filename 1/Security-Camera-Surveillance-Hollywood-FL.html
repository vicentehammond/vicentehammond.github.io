<p>CR's take: The Wyze Web Cam V2 is a terrific security camera and a sensational value. It receives an Outstanding score for video quality and is easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It also succeeds in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 2 week of free storage for motion-trigged video clips, person detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to save video footage locally on an SD card.
