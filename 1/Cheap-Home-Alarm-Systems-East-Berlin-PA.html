<p>Research studies show surveillance cameras minimize criminal offense. HD CCTV systems are compatible with traditional analog CCTV cameras. If you bought cameras before 2010 or if you have coax cable television (look at the cord behind the TELEVISION that goes to the cable television box) in your existing security system that means you have conventional analog CCTV security cameras. If you buy HD-CCTV security system, you can upgrade your existing analog CCTV security system without sacrificing your coax infrastructure.
