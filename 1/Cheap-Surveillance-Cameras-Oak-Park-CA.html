As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally normal considering that the entrance and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once clients realize that the affordable customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's normally far too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
