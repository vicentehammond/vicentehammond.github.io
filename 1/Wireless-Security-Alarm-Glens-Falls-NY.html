<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the same resolution spec as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being topped a much broader location and therefore provides less pixels per inch. Here is what this implies, by method of an example. Presume 2 cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This implies the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread that image throughout a far larger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
<p>Door and window sensing units are contact motion sensors that set off an alarm when the safeguarded door or window opens. Like stand-alone motion detectors, these can trigger when you're far from home or whenever you pick.

These sensors can operate as part of your security system or on their own, and they differ in size and design from tiny, streamlined sensors to obvious and large. Sensing units also differ in sensitivity. Some may trigger when the door or window vibrates versus actually opening.</p>
