<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely normal since the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everybody getting in the store.
