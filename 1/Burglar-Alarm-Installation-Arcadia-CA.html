With clever sensing units, you and your pet can stay secured without fear of false alarms. It is better to have a different computer (server) for submitting video to the cloud.

CCTV is likewise grounded in situational crime prevention method, which argues that opportunities to upset can be minimized by changing a variety of mechanisms such as increasing the risk of a wrongdoer being captured, increasing the effort to devote the crime, decreasing rewards from criminal offense commission, and minimizing justifications that give rise to criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011). This suggests that the offender must be aware of the added surveillance for it to achieve its desired result.</p>
