The price of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, but the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't consistent during our testing. The Netatmo Invite doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to recognize already-identified faces. And regardless of having an appealing price and good efficiency, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has confusing cloud storage that adds $65 to $150 annually to the cost of an otherwise budget camera.</p>
