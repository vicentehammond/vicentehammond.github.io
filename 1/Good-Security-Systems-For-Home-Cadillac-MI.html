<p>The Canary is one of the biggest cameras we tested, and it provides two-way interaction with its paid Canary Subscription. The cost of the Canary View makes the size a bit more tasty, however the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't consistent during our screening. The Netatmo Invite doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it constantly asked us to recognize already-identified faces.

<p>The Wisenet SmartCam N2 provides totally free advantages like person detection, familiar-face alerts, and local storage on a microSD card. (Cloud storage begins at $5 monthly.) However, in our tests the familiar-face notifies worked just about 50 percent of the time and the camera regularly detached from the network several times a day (when whatever else on our network appeared fine). The app was also painfully slow when we accessed live streams and recorded clips, as well as when we made changes in the settings.</p>
