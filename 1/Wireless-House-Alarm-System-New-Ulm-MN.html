If you go away for a few days, a subscription likewise guarantees that you'll be covered. The Circle Safe Basic strategy provides 2 week of video storage for $4 per month per camera (compared with $5 for five days for Nest Aware). The $10 Premium plan bumps that up to 31 days of storage (compared to $10 for 10 days for Nest Aware) and adds motion zones, filter alternatives, and the ability to distinguish between people and other things.</p>
