Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and send images of a specific area of interest and are either monitored remotely by security workers or preprogramed to scan the specified location (La Vigne et al. 2011).

"Once the criminal activity and offence figures were gotten used to take account of the general downward pattern in crimes and offenses," criminologists discovered in one research study, "reductions were kept in mind in particular categories but there was no proof to suggest that the cameras had lowered crime in general in the city centre." A 2005 research study for the British Home Office likewise discovered that cameras did not cut criminal activity or the fear of criminal activity (as had a 2002 study, also for the British government).</p>
