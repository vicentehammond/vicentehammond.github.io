<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Gain Access To (WPA and WPA2) security protocols were later on developed to address the problems with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be broken. Using a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 randomly selected words) makes pre-shared essential WPA practically uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based upon the final IEEE 802.11 i change to the 802.11 requirement and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly remarkable on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
