<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Also great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling feature.

In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas.
