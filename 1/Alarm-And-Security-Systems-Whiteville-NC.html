<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Also good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Need to be a better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
