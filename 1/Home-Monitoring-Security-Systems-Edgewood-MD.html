<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Also great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
