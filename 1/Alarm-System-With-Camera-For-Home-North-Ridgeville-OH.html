We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Cam (KC120) for one of our top spots.

Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly fee (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limitations, we typically found action missing out on, thanks to irregular and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>

Ring Alarm supports Z-Wave, so you can integrate your clever outlets with your overall security system. With the advances in innovation, monitoring a home security system is relatively simple.
