Will there be several different devices using the wifi at the same time, think about laptops, ipads, or streaming service like Netflix.

<p>Frontpoint's outdoor cameras are the most affordable in terms of both equipment cost and regular monthly monitoring costs.

Its wireless installation provides you a lot of flexibility. If the camera is battery powered you can position it pretty much anywhere without any wires, getting rid of and recharging the battery when it runs low, which is generally prompted through its app. Obviously the advantage is that these can be put anywhere very easily, but the disadvantage is that if it's easy for you to remove the camera to change the battery, it'll probably be simple for burglars to eliminate it too.</p>
