<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Must be a much better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
<p>All of this will cost you, though: A single camera (with the center) is $399, and extra cameras are $299 each.

And if you wish to save 4K videos, it's an extra $1.99 per camera per month, on top of the regular monthly plan, the latter of which is waived for the very first year. But if you want the absolute best when it pertains to video quality, the Arlo Ultra has it.</p>
