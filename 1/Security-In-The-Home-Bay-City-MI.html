<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Must be a much better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
<p>All of this will cost you, though: A single camera (with the center) is $399, and extra cameras are $299 each.

But if you want the absolute best when it pertains to video quality, the Arlo Ultra has it.</p>
