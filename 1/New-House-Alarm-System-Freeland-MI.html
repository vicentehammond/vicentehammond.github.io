<p>Pelco offers video surveillance cameras and video management solutions for commercial environments such as office complexes, shopping centers, others, and hotels.

The process is generally quicker and you can prevent any appointment-scheduling acrobatics when you choose to DIY.</p>

<p>As you just learned, there are two broad classifications of security cameras. What you usually find at stores are consumer-grade cameras, which usually come 8 or 16 cameras bundled with a video recorder and sell for less than a thousand dollars (US $) for the set. The 2nd classification of camera, commercial-grade cameras, generally starts at about $400 (United States) per camera-- a significantly higher price.

Property owners selecting a system needs to look for a dependable, reputable company.

Trusted companies tend to have much better equipment and customer service also.</p>
