To accomplish nearly anything, someone live" needed to be on the other side of the table or telephone line, specifically when dealing with international and national business.

Typically, CCTV is most effective as an active system, with a security personnel monitoring the passages and somebody else, someplace, viewing video surveillance monitors for support. Whatever is synchronized and everything takes place in genuine time.</p>
