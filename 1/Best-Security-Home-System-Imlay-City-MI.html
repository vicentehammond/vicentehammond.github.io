<p>Another essential topic to discuss is camera resolution. It can be confusing to comprehend just how much suffices. In this post, the term resolution" refers to the number of dots (pixels) that comprise a video picture; the more dots, the more in-depth the video image. The very same holds true of high-resolution TV sets, and the 2 most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution contains about 4 times as much image information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are likewise manufactured in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no.
