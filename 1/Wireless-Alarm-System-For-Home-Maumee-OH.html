With wireless security, your cameras, sensing units, lights and other security equipment are all linked to one base station or panel to get sensors required to manage your equipment including enabling, disabling and sending you instantaneous signals. Once a signal is received, you'll get an alert from the security provider's mobile app, text, e-mail, or web portal.

<p>Flood lights are frequently used in combination with motion detectors. When sensors identify motion, the lights light up the surrounding area, which will allow you to see who is on your home and will potentially frighten intruders.

Flood lights can hinder vandals or frighten them away, but as a single piece of equipment, they are more for your assurance than for home protection.</p>
