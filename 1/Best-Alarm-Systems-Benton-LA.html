<p>B. This chapter governs alarm system systems planned to summon cops department personnel, requires registration, assessment of charges for extreme false burglar alarms, offers procedures for repeat offenders, and supplies an effective date. While some vestiges of the old industry stay, today's property owners exist with a lot more options.
