Incorrect alarms are known to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might result in fines from the provider or the authorities if they happen often enough. Another prospective disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment should be changed or charged routinely in order to keep the system working.
