<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change.

Need to be a better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
