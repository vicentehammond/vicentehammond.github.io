<p>Cross-zoning is a technique that does not require a new keypad. Using multiple sensors to monitor activity in one location, software analyses input from all the sources. For instance, if a motion detector journeys in one location, the signal is taped and the central-station monitor notifies the client.

<p>When looking at a normal camera image, you would be hard-pressed to tell the difference in between 1080p and 4K resolution. The one major benefit of 4K resolution is the ability to resolve detail after the truth, which means that users can zoom in on information such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays. However, while 4K resolution uses some advantages, it also brings with it some drawbacks. 4K images are huge and take up a lot of taping storage area. A lot, in reality, that they need about four times the hard disk space of 1080p to tape the very same length of video footage. If extended video storage is essential, be prepared to invest more cash.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially impressive on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. However if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
