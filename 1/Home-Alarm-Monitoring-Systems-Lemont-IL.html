<p>Amongst IP security alternatives, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras collect and send out information over a wireless network. These security cameras link to a user's home wifi network and enables that user to see the footage from anywhere. A typical mistaken belief is that wireless suggests the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras may still need a power cord. Wired security cameras are linked to a recorder directly which then connects to the internet and a router. Lastly, wire-free cameras are entirely cable television free and battery powered. Although battery replacements are required, these are the most convenient choice to install and all of the tape-recorded footage is saved in the cloud.</p>
