<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, normally described as shock sensing units, are different because they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which travel through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling.

Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn create an alarm condition.</p>
