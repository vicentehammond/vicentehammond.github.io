<h3>Best Home Security Camera in North Carolina</h3>
<p>We do not recommend the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complex than it needs to be. Recordings, notifies, and integration all require separate IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are saved for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month cost (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limitations, we often found action missing, thanks to lengthy and inconsistent gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
<p>Wireless security cameras leverage your home or businesses WiFi connection to produce a surveillance network. Because they tend to get image distortion when zooming in to objects that are far away, these are excellent to utilize to monitor small to medium sized spaces and buildings.
