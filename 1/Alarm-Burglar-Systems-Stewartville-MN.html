Nevertheless, you do require to subscribe to the external monitoring service (from â‚¤ 12.99 each month) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get notifies on your phone if the sensing units have actually been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are available that have additional sensors and key fobs, too.</p>

In our screening, we paid particular attention to taping quality and length, frequency of informs, the app interface, smart-home, and geofencing integration.</p>
<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. However if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
