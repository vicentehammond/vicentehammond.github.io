Nevertheless, you do require to subscribe to the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 each month) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get notifies on your phone if the sensing units have actually been activated.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. However if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
