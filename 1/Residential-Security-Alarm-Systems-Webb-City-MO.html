<p>Lots of wireless home security systems are can be set up by the house owner and have an easy setup procedure.

That stated, we actually liked Brinks' simple plan alternatives. You'll have three options to choose from, which range from basic intrusion protection to full-on intrusion protection + home automation + video surveillance. We truly took pleasure in using Brinks' video features, and we like how their top-tier package features an HD video doorbell for good step.</p>

Because ADT works with third-party dealers to install and sell equipment, your customer care experience may deviate a bit, depending on what dealership you end up dealing with.
