The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation gradually evolved into the highly advanced yet economical systems offered today. The first usages of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the ways to tape-record video and view it later.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not terrific-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
