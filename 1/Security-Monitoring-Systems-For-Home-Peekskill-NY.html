I Would absolutely purchase from cctvsecuritypros again. I highly recommend this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand out-- it's what supplies the video history and smarter notifies, for example. Nevertheless, those features come at a relatively high rate: $5 each month ($50 per year) for the first camera for 5 days of video history, $10 each month ($100 annually) for 10 days of video history, or $30 per month ($300 per year) for 30 days of video history.

The alarm doesn't include a wifi security camera however you can purchase a number of various Yale cameras that will work with the alarm as optional extras.
