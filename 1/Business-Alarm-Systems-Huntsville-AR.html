<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling function.

In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely regular considering that the entrance and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.
