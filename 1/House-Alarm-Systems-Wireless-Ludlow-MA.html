<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Also good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
