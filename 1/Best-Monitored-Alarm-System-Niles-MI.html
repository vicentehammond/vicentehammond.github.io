<p>Unlike most other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ).

When utilized in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs each time you stroll by. Oddly, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
