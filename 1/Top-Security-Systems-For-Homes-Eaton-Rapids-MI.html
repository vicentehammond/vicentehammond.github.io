<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. Nevertheless, Nest Secure does have its drawbacks: many BBB customers have problems with poor tech support and an absence of details on service warranties. Moreover, there is sometimes up to an hour delay in receiving alerts on your phone from the Nest Guard, a worrying problem.

Like the Ping camera, the Vivint Outdoor Camera records 20-second clips. After we used the Anker EufyCam for nearly six months, we're shocked to report that it is on track to provide on its guarantee of up to one year of battery life. What we do not love is that it leaves spaces in between recordings, which ranged anywhere from 4 to 34 seconds, depending on the settings.
