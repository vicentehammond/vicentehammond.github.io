<h3>Motion Detector Alarm in Front Royal VA</h3>

<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Also nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
