<h2>Video Surveillance Equipment Dublin</h2>

<p>We have actually long been fans of the Netatmo Invite camera (₤ 199), with its downplayed looks and face acknowledgment software. The latter allows you to see specifically when a specific person arrives at your home - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner appeared on time.

They also plan to release a wise smoke detector and siren later this year, that makes this an even much better proposition.</p>
<p>I apologize to all the Wink fans out there, however to call Wink Lookout a security system is a stretch.

Instead, you turn notifies on and off. As you can't disarm it, it can't do things that a normal self-monitored system can do like trigger a camera to record or set off the siren.
