When a provider allows clients to monitor their own homes, this is called self-monitoring." Customers can monitor their homes with the assistance of motion detectors, sensors, and security cameras.

In most cases, customers can also inspect the app to see live video from security cameras.</p>

However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
