<p>GO2 supplies full-service Video Surveillance Installation of hd (HD), IP, digital, outdoor, and wireless Security Camera Systems. Of course, the apparent disadvantage to a wired security system is that the preliminary install can be expensive. If the system was not installed throughout the homebuilding procedure, setting one up might require drilling holes into walls, running new wires, patching drywall and gaining access to difficult spots that are sealed off in attics or basements.
