<p>Get best-in-class security, plus wise home automation the entire household will like. ADT is a household name, so we regularly check out their systems to ensure they're still up-to-task. In our newest round of testing, we realized that ADT is the most popular provider for a reason. We believe their home protection + home automation + video packages are nipping at the heels of Vivint.
