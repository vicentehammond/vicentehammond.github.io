<p>A good concept is to inspect it with your smartphone if you are not sure about whether the wireless CCTV camera type will work in a specific location. There are advantages to both landline and cellular monitoring, so do not just rely on cost when making your choice. Home alarm systems monitored with a traditional landline do not need power to work.

<p>So what occurs if something triggers your alarm but you're in a meeting with a vendor and you do not get the alert?

If your system equipment consists of an audible alarm, the noise might frighten would-be intruders-- if you're fortunate. However the cops will not come until you personally call them.</p>

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly outstanding on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. But if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
