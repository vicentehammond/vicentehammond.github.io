The 2nd generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based upon the final IEEE 802.11 i modification to the 802.11 requirement and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance.

Entering the code on the alarm system's keypad and switching off the system will end this procedure with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
