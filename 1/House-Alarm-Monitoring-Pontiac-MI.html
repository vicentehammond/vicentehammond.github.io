For the ones that don't, you are able to see a live video feed of your home at any time you access your system; however, nothing is recorded. The systems with video storage usually include either a local storage or cloud storage alternative. A local storage option conserves a pre-determined variety of video clips on the device itself. This alternative is usually cost-free. A cloud storage option saves your video in the cloud.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.

For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
