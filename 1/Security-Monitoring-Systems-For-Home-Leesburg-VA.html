Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are stored for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly cost (or $80 per year) to save 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limitations, we typically found action missing out on, thanks to irregular and lengthy spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter event notices just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The membership is better when used in high-traffic areas.
