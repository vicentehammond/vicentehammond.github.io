<p>So, while alarm systems may have some advantage for alarm owners as part of a general security plan, the question remains whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood ought to shoulder a share of the cost. If alarm use led to boosted public safety-- that is, alarms led to much higher burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, less thefts across an entire jurisdiction-- its public value would be more apparent. However, the truth that alarm calls are extremely incorrect and do not contribute substantially to authorities capability to apprehend burglars makes the underwriting of alarm response by authorities and entire communities (all taxpayers support authorities reaction to alarmed homes) a expensive and inefficient  method to burglary decrease across a whole jurisdiction.</p>
