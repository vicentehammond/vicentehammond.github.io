<p>The majority of security cameras can be used both inside and outdoors. They usually have the very same functions like night vision or remote watching, but they differ in toughness. Outdoor cameras must be weather condition resistant and sometimes, totally waterproof. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather resistance score are the most resilient. Bullet cameras tend to be among the most popular outdoor options since their design allows for minimum glare. In regards to detection, it is better to have a camera equipped with infrared detection instead of motion detection.

<p>When motion is spotted, nearly all outdoor security cameras are geared up with a motion sensor that will set off the camera to tape video.

For an additional layer of security, search for a camera with sound detection that can let you know if somebody is out there even if they're out of variety of the camera lens and the motion sensor.

(We think this is a more valuable function if you're putting the Circle 2 outside, where vehicles often pass.) Although having the subscription makes this camera smarter, it's fantastic that it's not necessary, as it is with some cameras, including the Nest Webcam.</p>
