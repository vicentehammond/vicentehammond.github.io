<p>Developing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or residential property is the responsibility of the whole neighborhood. Storage capability: For video recorders, the first concern you have to ask yourself is just how much storage you will need. The response depends upon a number of elements: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video you mean to store and how long you plan to keep documented video footage. The footage is going to consume up storage space quickly if there are numerous cameras shooting in a greater resolution. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest video footage when you reach the system's capacity, however if you're not careful, the system might overwrite archived video footage that you still need.</p>
