For beginners, it looks stunning: the all-white design and black camera face are seriously spacey (if eerily similar to the AI in 2001: An Area Odyssey). It's far from the horrid metal CCTV box that you might call to mind when you think of a home security camera.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching.
