<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Likewise good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
